Thanks for your pull request! We really appreciate all OSS efforts, big or small.

Before submitting, make sure to:

- Run `make init` if you have not already to download dependencies to `vendor`.
- Run `make generate` to make sure there is no diff.
- Run `make` to make sure all tests pass. This is functionally equivalent to the tests run on CI.
